This Latex Beamer theme is intended for use by Purdue University students in the School of Aeronautics & Astronautics (AAE).
It is based on Andrei Barbu's theme (https://github.com/abarbu/purdue-beamer), but was modified to include a non-white background and the AAE banner on the title page.

The example.tex file demonstrates how to use the theme and, in general, how to use some simple features of the Beamer package. 
Hopefully it is instructional and helpful.
